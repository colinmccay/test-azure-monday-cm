                <header> <p style="font-size: x-large; color: navy;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-style: italic;"> INTRODUCTION</header>
                <header> <p style="font: large; color: navy;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> I have always loved working with computers and learning new things since I was young.
                Some of my favorite hobbies are on the computer, such as playing video games and making electronic music. It always amazed me knwoing how flawlessly
            the games or computer programs worked. I used to always also mess around with websites on the internet, copying and pasting the code and trying to figure out 
        how it worked. I thought computer science would be an interesting major because of this. To learn how all the websites worked and figure out what went into them, and what coding was 
    required for the video games always seemed interesting. </header>
    <header> <p style="font: large; color: navy;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">More about me, my hobbies include making music and playing video games
     games like I said earlier. I also love doing tennis, going for runs, and eating food. I love cars too, and working with them and learning how they work, and tuning them. 
     In my spare time I love hanging out with friends
    and just having fun. One thing most people are suprised about is that I am an only child. Although I usually have a lot of time on my hands, I tend to
 wait until the last minute to do things, because I always put them off and do other things instead. </header>

              <header> <p style="color: navy;font-size: x-large;font-family: monospace;font-style: italic;"> My Favorite Hobby </header>
                <header> <p style="color: navy;font-size: large;font-family: monospace;"> I love making music as one of my hobbies. I use a computer program called 
                Logic Pro X to make songs. Usually I like making hip hop beats or chillout songs, but I enjoy making both depending on what I am feeling.
            I also like working with other producers or artists to make songs. My favorite part about making music is coming up with original melodies and 
        songs and seeing how they come together as I make them. </header>
